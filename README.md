# JerryServerFoundation
Jerry's(Jet) Server Foundation

This is a Server engine based on socket programming and multi-thread for serving client-server communicating. 
It is still in developing and the current version is compiled under VS 2017. I am trying to make it cross platform on Win32 and linux.
